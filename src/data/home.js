    "Hello, I'm Mohammed Aman Bhuiyan. I am currently working as a Research Assistant in the CCDS Lab at IUB, and I also work part-time as an AI/ML Researcher at Penta Global Limited. I earned my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka.",
    "My research interests are primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multimodality. In the field of NLP, I focus on areas such as low-resource languages, hate speech detection, and improving the inference speed of language models. In multimodal research, I am engaged in projects related to visual question answering, modality alignment, addressing modality gaps, and developing multimodal adapters. Additionally, I have also explored several important & popular topics Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Posterior Collapse, State Space Models (SSMs), and Diffusion models."
